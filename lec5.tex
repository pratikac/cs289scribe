\section{Log-rank conjecture}
\label{sec:log_rank}

We start the lecture with a discussion on the log-rank conjecture. We have already seen that rank of the characteristic matrix $\mf$ of a function $f : \X \times \Y \to \cbrac{0,1}$ is a very good lower-bound on the deterministic communication complexity $\df$. A prominent conjecture however is the following which states that $\df$ is essentially upper-bounded by the log-rank of $\mf$.

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:log_rank}
For some constant $c > 0$, for all functions $f$,
$$
\log \rk \mf \leq \df \leq \sqbrac{\log \rk \mf}^c + c.
$$
\end{conjecture}
\begin{remark}
The original conjecture was proposed with $c=1$. However we will see today that $c$ is essentially large. In particular we shall prove that $\df \geq \sqbrac{\log \rk \mf}^{1.58}$.

Note that we have already proved the first inequality in previous classes, the second inequality on the other hand is a hard open problem in the field. To put things into perspective, we proved in the last lecture that
$$
\df \leq \rk_\reals \mf + 1
$$
which is an exponentially-worse upper bound than what the conjecture claims.
\end{remark}

Let us introduce the following theorem which quantifies the above discussion.
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:log_rank_bound}
There is a function $f: \cbrac{0,1}^n \times \cbrac{0,1}^n \to \cbrac{0,1}$ such that
$$
\df = \Omega(n) \qquad \mathrm{but},
$$
$$
\log \rk \mf \leq \bigo\rbrac{n^{\frac{1}{1.58\ldots}}}.
$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
First note that the above theorem implies $\df \geq \sqbrac{\log \rk \mf}^{1.58\ldots}$ which means that the constant $c$ in Conj.~\ref{conj:log_rank} is greater than $1.58$. To prove this theorem, we will construct a ``gadget'' and compose it with itself many times to construct a complicated function which will give us the above bounds.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
Define a real-valued polynomial with three binary inputs $h : \cbrac{0,1}^3 \to {0,1}$ as
$$
h(z_1, z_2, z_3) = z_1 + z_2 + z_3 - z_1 z_2 - z_2 z_3 - z_1 z_3.
$$
Note that $h$ is symmetric with respect to its arguments. We can now see that if exactly one of the $z$s is 1, $h = 1$, if exactly two $z$s are 1, we have $h = 1$. For all other cases, $h = 0$. In order words,
$$
h(z_1, z_2, z_3) = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \quad \mathrm{if}\ z_1 + z_2 + z_3 = 1\\
0 & \quad \mathrm{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$
Define a recursive function $H_d$ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Hd}. To construct $H_d$, compose $h$ with itself $d$ times. In more cumbersome notation,
$$
H_d = h(H_{d-1}, H_{d-1}, H_{d-1})
$$
with $H_0 = h$. Thus, $H_d$ has $3^d$ leaves. We can also compute $H_d$ for a few special cases which we need, the others we do not care for.
$$
H_d(z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_{3^d}) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \quad \mathrm{if}\ \sum_{i} z_i = 1\\
0 & \quad \mathrm{if}\ \sum_{i} z_i = 0\\
\mathrm{don't care} & \quad \mathrm{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$
Let $f(x,y) = H_d(x \aand y)$, i.e., the length of the inputs of Alice and Bob, $n = 3^d$. \pc{Note that this is the set-disjointness problem}{}

To prove this theorem we will use a result which we have not proved yet, viz., for the disjointness problem $\disj_n$. This problem is really one of the cornerstones in the theory communication complexity and plays a large role in deriving important results. Well, in any case, we use the fact that $\df \geq \Omega(3^d)$ if $f = \disj_n$.

\end{proof}
